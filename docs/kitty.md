# kitty
kitty is a terminal emulator that I found easy to configure and has a lot of interesting keyboard shoartcuts to learn. I perticularly like the way kitty can split the window into multiple screens.

Here are the short cuts I have learned so far:
- ctrl shift enter (split screen)
- ctrl shift w (close focused screen)
- ctrl shit 1 (focus screen 1)
- ctrl shift t (open new tab)
- ctrl shift q (close tab)
