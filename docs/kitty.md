# kitty
I want to try kitty as an alternative terminal emulator. I've never really used any features of a terminal emulator such as iterm but I found kitty to be easy to modify and the shortcuts for splitting the screen was the feature that lured me in.

I want to learn more keyboard shortcuts by using this project. The keyboard shortcuts are different between mac and linux, but I will type down the ones that I've learned every day here.

# Shortcuts
- ctrl shift enter (new window in split screen)
- ctrl shift w (delete focused split screen)
- ctrl shift 1 (move focus to split screen one)
- ctrl shift t (open new tab)
- ctrl shift q (close tab)
